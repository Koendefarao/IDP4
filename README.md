# LightweightPHPFramework

A simple php framework written by me for usage in small projects. It is inspired of CakePHP and shares some of its features. It also contains a own orm which is meant as a placeholder for a better one. Thus it's limited to a few features.

This framework is compatable with php 5.2, but it is advised to use it with higher version because its lacks a few handy security features like the function "hash". If you are using a later version of php you can change AuthHelper to use hash instead of sha to hash the passwords.

The framework contains a sample project of a webshop I made with it.

I hope it helps you as much as it did help me.
